They basically locked up the division title by dominating the Cowboys Sunday night. Now they have to try and lock up the top seed.

The division is over and the schedule is soft. That means their game with the Steelers in a few weeks will likely decide the top seed in the AFC.

The Steelers we saw beat the Titans is the group we expected to see this year. They will be a factor in late January if they keep that up.

Saints
Saints
They showed that their future Hall of Fame quarterback could still win games with his right arm by rallying the Saints past the Redskins. The defense needs to get back on track this week against the Rams.

There is no need to take Case Keenum out of the lineup. With the pressure of that talk hanging over his head, he played well against the Rams. Let it ride.

They fell flat in the second half against Minnesota and now face a brutal stretch of games. They need to get the offense back on track quickly.

They come off their bye with a winnable game against the Jets. They seemed to be getting it going before the bye on offense, and now they get back Greg Olsen and Ryan Kalil.

They don't do a lot on offense, but that defense is special. They lead the NFL in scoring defense.

They've won two in a row and now have three straight at home, starting Sunday against the Bucs. The offense is just fine now.

They've lost four of five games and the offense isn't scoring anymore. The gimmicks don't fool like they did early in the season.

They would be out of the playoffs if they started right now. They are in big trouble.

This is Matthew Stafford's team. Let him throw it around and ride his right arm. They aren't going to be a run team as much as they want to run it more.

Their injuries have crippled them the past two weeks and now they face a must-win game on Thursday against the Chargers.

They just don't look right on offense. Marcus Mariota needs to pick up his play.  So does the run game.

If the playoffs started today, they would be in the party. Their defense was impressive at Green Bay, but the offense has to do more.

They are 4-6 and have a tough road game Thursday at Dallas to face the Cowboys. They still have a chance to win the AFC West.

The change at quarterback to go from Tyrod Taylor to Nathan Peterman was a mistake. Now what?

They might need to make a quarterback change. It's just not working with Jay Cutler, who is in the concussion protocol this week.

They are still alive after beating the Cardinals. But they can't afford any more losses - that's for sure.

They've had to fight through way too many injuries this season. Now the question will be whether Bruce Arians comes back for another season.

They come off their bye with a game at home against the Titans. They have to be happy with what they are getting from Jacoby Brissett in place of Andrew Luck, but he is in the concussion protocol.

They play close games, but can't seem to pull them out. The good news is Mitchell Trubisky is getting better, but he gets that Eagles defense this week.

They competed the past two weeks, which is a good sign. But will they win a game? I don't think so.
