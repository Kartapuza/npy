They just keep on rolling. Is there any team in the AFC that can beat them? I don't think so.

It wasn't easy against the Bengals, but nothing has been this season. It's all about beating the Patriots in Week 16.

Case Keenum is playing outstanding football to go with that impressive defense. They face a tough road trip to Carolina this week.

They would be the second seed now in the conference after losing to Seattle and they face a tough road game against the Rams. That's a tough turnaround.

They face an enormous game this week at home against the Eagles. The good news is the defense is getting better by the week.

If they can beat the Falcons on the road at Atlanta, they will essentially have a two-game lead in the division with three to go. Alvin Kamara has been sensational.

What has happened to the defense the past two weeks? That unit was supposed to be better than they've been.

Aside from Russell Wilson's outstanding play, the defense is coming off a good showing against the Eagles. That's a good sign with all the injuries.

Their defense is carrying this team, but Blake Bortles had his best game throwing it last week. They will need him this week against Seattle.

They are winning, but it sure isn't pretty. Is that a sign of a good team, or one just finding a way?

They face a big one this week against the Steelers. The good news is Joe Flacco came alive throwing it last week.

They saved their season - for now - by beating the Redskins last week. They can make a real push down the stretch with a soft schedule.

They are 6-6 and alive in the wild-card chase. They need to keep it afloat until Aaron Rodgers gets back in a few weeks.

They still don't score enough on offense. They will need to score more at Kansas City this week.

Two consecutive losses has this team at .500 and trying to stay alive in the playoff chase. Matt Stafford's injured hand bears watching.

They just can't beat the Patriots. Until they can, they can't be a real threat in the division.

Their 5-0 start seems like years ago. At 6-6, they have to find a way to win this week at home against the Raiders.

They can start worrying about next year now after losing at home to the Rams. Will Bruce Arians be back?

The injuries have ended their chances, but there were some good things from last week's game. DeAndre Hopkins is a flat out star.

It's hard to believe this team has lost eight straight games. The bad quarterback play has killed the Broncos.

Firing coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese was the right thing to do. So was putting Eli Manning back in as the starter.

At least they know they have a weapon for the future with Josh Gordon back. But who will be throwing to him?
